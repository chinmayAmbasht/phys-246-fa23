# phys-246-fa23
The repository contains projects undertaken as part of PHYS 246: Introduction to Modern Computational Physics as taught by Prof. Bryan Clark at UIUC in Fall  2023.

The projects include:
1. Measuring pi: Using series approximations, plotting techniques, and Monte Carlo techniques
2. Dynamics: Using dynamical simulations of throwing a ball
3. Orbital Dynamics: Using numerical simulations of the Solar System
4. Exoplanets: Signal processing, Fourier transforms and Data manipulation
5. Chaos:
